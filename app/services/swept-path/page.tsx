                  Management Plan (TMP) tailored to your specific scope of work.

                  Attention to detail is one of our strong suits when it comes

                  traffic control strategies and the design of specific measures
                  to mitigate those hazards. Our project managers consider all
                  relevant factors, including traffic volume, speed limits, site

                  work closely with local councils, regulatory authorities and
                  stakeholders to ensure your TMP complies with all necessary
                  requirements and can be implemented and approved seamlessly.

                  T&S Traffic Control provides professional swept path analysis
                  services across Australia to ensure your project’s vehicle
                  movements are safe and compliant. Swept path analysis is
                  essential for assessing how vehicles—especially large or
                  articulated ones—navigate through constrained sites,
                  intersections, or construction zones.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Using advanced software, our experienced team simulates and
                  analyses the turning paths of various vehicles based on their
                  dimensions and your site layout. This process helps identify
                  potential conflicts, clearance issues, and optimises site
                  access for construction, delivery, or emergency vehicles.

                  Our swept path analysis service includes detailed diagrams and
                  recommendations to ensure compliance with Australian Standards
                  and local authority requirements. We help you minimise risk,
                  avoid costly design changes, and ensure the safety of all road
                  users and workers.
